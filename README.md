# Project Problem Statement
17% of teenagers (Aged 12-17) reported that they feel socially isolated. Lonely teenagers have a higher risk of poorer mental health outcomes which can result in various psychological issues such as social anxiety, depression, or self-harm, even moreso for newly arrived migrant teenagers. Immigrant teenagers who have recently moved to Victoria who feel socially isolated due to cultural and language barriers, like any other human beings, need to form meaningful relationships with others. A method to assist these immigrant teenagers to ease into Victorian culture and establish social networks with both young people in their cultural group and other Australian teenagers would mitigate the chances of social isolation.

# Project Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to help Migrant teens who are trying to assimilate into Melbornian culture in hopes of decreasing their isolation from society. The hope is that they can find friends through learning about the slang, culture, sites, find activities, cultural festivals, and diasporic communities if they miss home. The main purpose is to decrease isolation for Migrant teens.

Iteration 1 is mostly informational, and the only true use of a "database" that can encourage users to come back is the ability to look for professional help agencies that help them with their social anxiety or depression. The visualisation includes information such as name of agency, phone number, postcode, and language supported.
