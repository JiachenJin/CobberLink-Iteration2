		<p> </p><p>The City of Melbourne recognises with respect that it is situated on the Kulin Nation's traditional lands. This unique location is now referred to as European named melbourne.</p><p>Today, Melbourne is one of the world's great multicultural cities and a vital gathering point. Melbourne has traditionally been a vital gathering point and destination for social, educational, sports, and cultural activities for the Wurundjeri, Boonerwrung, Taungurong, Djajawurrung, and Wathaurung peoples that comprise the Kulin Nation.</p><h6>History of Melbourne</h6><p>Melbourne is Victoria's capital and is home to about 4 million people. Many Melbourne residents live in the suburbs east and south of the Yarra River, which are centered on Port Phillip Bay and reach as far east as Mount Dandenong.</p><p>Melbourne was established on the Yarra River in 1835 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1803 to construct a colony within the Port Phillip Bay heads at Sorrento.</p><p>In 1850, the Port Phillip District declared its independence from New South Wales. Melbourne flourished in the 1850's as a consequence of the northern gold rush.</p><p>Melbourne is considered as the world's top sport city and has a reputation for being more elegant than its northern neighbor Sydney, possessing some of the country's best restaurants and being recognized as the country's most significant financial hub.</p><p>As with the majority of Australian colonies, the British colonization of Victoria was initially motivated by fear of prospective French settlement. By the late eighteenth century, both British and French explorers had thoroughly explored the shore.</p><p>Lieutenant David Collins, along by a band of convicts and free settlers, arrived on the beaches of Port Phillip (near Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula) in October 1803 and founded a short-lived colony in response to a feared French threat.</p><p>Collins obtained authorization to relocate the colony to Van Diemen's Land in May 1804 and his short effort at colonization was abandoned.</p><p>Throughout the 1810's and 1820's, whalers and sealers frequented Port Phillip, working the coast from Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) to South Australia.</p><p>The true drive for permanent colonization came from land-based explorers who, after exploring south from Sydney, crossed the Murrumbidgee River and continued south to the southern shore. At 1824, Hume and Hovell arrived in Port Phillip. They confused it for Western Port, and two years later, relying on their false advise, Western Port was created as a military and prison outpost. It lasted a year and a half.</p><p>Near this time, John Batman, a Van Diemen's Land resident, attempted to get clearance from the Governor of New South Wales to colonize the land around Western Port. He had been heartened by stories of fertile land and abundant pastures. Fearful of the consequences of establishing a second colony, the Governor refused Batman permission.</p><p>This turned out to be a meaningless gesture. In November 1834, eight years later, Edward Henty defied the government of New South Wales and established in Portland Bay. Batman crossed Bass Strait in early 1835, pushed on by Henty's example, and in June 1835 notoriously 'bought' property on the western bank of Port Phillip from the indigenous Aborigines.</p><p>Batman surveyed the beaches of Port Phillip and found a location for a town during this time period. Within a year, the settlement of Melbourne started to develop on the Yarra River's banks.</p><p>Melbourne was surveyed and named in 1837, with magistrate Captain William Lonsdale being sent from Sydney to ensure law and order. Attempts to prevent settlement were manifestly unsuccessful, and the government of New South Wales was compelled to cope with Victoria as a prosperous and semi-autonomous colony. This became a reality in September 1839, with the arrival of Charles La Trobe, the newly appointed Superintendent of the Port Phillip District. Following his death, the colony formed a distinct police force, a customs office, and, probably most significantly, a distinct land office.</p><p>By 1 July 1851, when Victoria became a colony, there were already over 80 000 people who live south of the Murray-Murrumbidgee more than six million sheep grazing on permanent farms.</p><p>In principle, Victoria would have remained a rural economy (although more than 20% of the state's 80 000 inhabitants lived in Melbourne in 1851), but the finding of gold altered everything.</p><h6>The Gold Rush</h6><h6><img src=\"http://cobberlink.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ross-sokolovski-UAFXj9dRpwo-unsplash-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"634\" height=\"357\" /></h6><p>By November 1851, alluvial gold had been found in Clunes, Anderson's Creek, Buninyong, Ballarat, Mount Alexander, and what was then called Sandhurst. By early 1852, the streets of Melbourne were nearly vacant, and ships from all over the globe were unloading anxious miners on Melbourne's wharves.</p><p>By 1854, the colony's population had increased from 80 000 to 300 000, the value of imported products had surpassed an incredible 18 million, and the colony was receiving everything necessary for mining, from food to dwellings and equipment. Over 86 million grams of gold were mined in 1856. This would provide the groundwork for unparalleled growth, establishing Melbourne as the country's financial capital and Victoria as an extraordinarily prosperous colony.</p><p>In the 1850s, more than 100 million dollars' worth of gold was extracted from the soil.</p><p>In 1855, the colony's administration was decentralized with the establishment of a Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. The issue was that membership and voting rights were conditional on the purchase of substantial parcels of property. Thus, the first parliament was nearly completely composed of attorneys, prosperous businesspeople, prosperous squatters, and merchants. They may have represented the state's 80 000 inhabitants in 1851, but they pale in comparison to the 300 000 in 1855.</p><p>Although Melbourne had depressions in the 1890s and 1930s, it remained an affluent and thriving city for the most part. The state's vibrancy and dynamism continued after World War II, when huge numbers of non-English speaking immigrants (especially from Italy and Greece) came as a consequence of Australia's concerted effort to recruit migrants from Europe. Melbourne is sometimes claimed (inaccurately) to be the world's second-biggest Greek city (it was subsequently reclassified as the world's third-largest Greek city) and the largest Italian city outside of Italy. Lygon Street, renowned for its cosmopolitan food, is undoubtedly a symbol of the city's cultural variety.</p><p style=\"font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">You can learn more information about the history of Melbourne from the <a href=\"http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/melbourne-heritage/Pages/melbourne-heritage.aspx\">Government of Melbourne's historical website</a>.</p>

This unique location is now referred to as European named melbourne.<\\/p><p>Today, Melbourne is one of the world's great multicultural cities and a vital gathering point. Melbourne has traditionally been a vital gathering point and destination for social, educational, sports, and cultural activities for the Wurundjeri, Boonerwrung, Taungurong, Djajawurrung, and Wathaurung peoples that comprise the Kulin Nation.<\\/p><h6>History of Melbourne<\\/h6><p>Melbourne is Victoria's capital and is home to about 4 million people. Many Melbourne residents live in the suburbs east and south of the Yarra River, which are centered on Port Phillip Bay and reach as far east as Mount Dandenong.<\\/p><p>Melbourne was established on the Yarra River in 1835 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1803 to construct a colony within the Port Phillip Bay heads at Sorrento.<\\/p><p>In 1850, the Port Phillip District declared its independence from New South Wales. Melbourne flourished in the 1850's as a consequence of the northern gold rush.<\\/p><p>Melbourne is considered as the world's top sport city and has a reputation for being more elegant than its northern neighbor Sydney, possessing some of the country's best restaurants and being recognized as the country's most significant financial hub.<\\/p><p>As with the majority of Australian colonies, the British colonization of Victoria was initially motivated by fear of prospective French settlement. By the late eighteenth century, both British and French explorers had thoroughly explored the shore.<\\/p><p>Lieutenant David Collins, along by a band of convicts and free settlers, arrived on the beaches of Port Phillip (near Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula) in October 1803 and founded a short-lived colony in response to a feared French threat.<\\/p><p>Collins obtained authorization to relocate the colony to Van Diemen's Land in May 1804 and his short effort at colonization was abandoned.<\\/p><p>Throughout the 1810's and 1820's, whalers and sealers frequented Port Phillip, working the coast from Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) to South Australia.<\\/p><p>The true drive for permanent colonization came from land-based explorers who, after exploring south from Sydney, crossed the Murrumbidgee River and continued south to the southern shore. At 1824, Hume and Hovell arrived in Port Phillip. They confused it for Western Port, and two years later, relying on their false advise, Western Port was created as a military and prison outpost. It lasted a year and a half.<\\/p><p>Near this time, John Batman, a Van Diemen's Land resident, attempted to get clearance from the Governor of New South Wales to colonize the land around Western Port. He had been heartened by stories of fertile land and abundant pastures. Fearful of the consequences of establishing a second colony, the Governor refused Batman permission.<\\/p><p>This turned out to be a meaningless gesture. In November 1834, eight years later, Edward Henty defied the government of New South Wales and established in Portland Bay. Batman crossed Bass Strait in early 1835, pushed on by Henty's example, and in June 1835 notoriously 'bought' property on the western bank of Port Phillip from the indigenous Aborigines.<\\/p><p>Batman surveyed the beaches of Port Phillip and found a location for a town during this time period. Within a year, the settlement of Melbourne started to develop on the Yarra River's banks.<\\/p><p>Melbourne was surveyed and named in 1837, with magistrate Captain William Lonsdale being sent from Sydney to ensure law and order. Attempts to prevent settlement were manifestly unsuccessful, and the government of New South Wales was compelled to cope with Victoria as a prosperous and semi-autonomous colony. This became a reality in September 1839, with the arrival of Charles La Trobe, the newly appointed Superintendent of the Port Phillip District. Following his death, the colony formed a distinct police force, a customs office, and, probably most significantly, a distinct land office.<\\/p><p>By 1 July 1851, when Victoria became a colony, there were already over 80 000 people who live south of the Murray-Murrumbidgee more than six million sheep grazing on permanent farms.<\\/p><p>In principle, Victoria would have remained a rural economy (although more than 20% of the state's 80 000 inhabitants lived in Melbourne in 1851), but the finding of gold altered everything.<\\/p><h6>The\\u00a0Gold Rush<\\/h6><h6><img class=\\\"wp-image-1874 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/cobberlink.xyz\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2022\\/04\\/ross-sokolovski-UAFXj9dRpwo-unsplash-300x169.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"634\\\" height=\\\"357\\\" \\/><\\/h6><p>By November 1851, alluvial gold had been found in Clunes, Anderson's Creek, Buninyong, Ballarat, Mount Alexander, and what was then called Sandhurst. By early 1852, the streets of Melbourne were nearly vacant, and ships from all over the globe were unloading anxious miners on Melbourne's wharves.<\\/p><p>By 1854, the colony's population had increased from 80 000 to 300 000, the value of imported products had surpassed an incredible 18 million, and the colony was receiving everything necessary for mining, from food to dwellings and equipment. Over 86 million grams of gold were mined in 1856. This would provide the groundwork for unparalleled growth, establishing Melbourne as the country's financial capital and Victoria as an extraordinarily prosperous colony.<\\/p><p>In the 1850s, more than 100 million dollars' worth of gold was extracted from the soil.<\\/p><p>In 1855, the colony's administration was decentralized with the establishment of a Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. The issue was that membership and voting rights were conditional on the purchase of substantial parcels of property. Thus, the first parliament was nearly completely composed of attorneys, prosperous businesspeople, prosperous squatters, and merchants. They may have represented the state's 80 000 inhabitants in 1851, but they pale in comparison to the 300 000 in 1855.<\\/p><p>Although Melbourne had depressions in the 1890s and 1930s, it remained an affluent and thriving city for the most part. The state's vibrancy and dynamism continued after World War II, when huge numbers of non-English speaking immigrants (especially from Italy and Greece) came as a consequence of Australia's concerted effort to recruit migrants from Europe. Melbourne is sometimes claimed (inaccurately) to be the world's second-biggest Greek city (it was subsequently reclassified as the world's third-largest Greek city) and the largest Italian city outside of Italy. Lygon Street, renowned for its cosmopolitan food, is undoubtedly a symbol of the city's cultural variety.<\\/p><p style=\\\"font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\\\">You can learn more information about the history of Melbourne from the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.melbourne.vic.gov.au\\/about-melbourne\\/melbourne-heritage\\/Pages\\/melbourne-heritage.aspx\\\">Government of Melbourne's historical website<\\/a>.<\\/p>\",\"align\":\"center\",\"typography_typography\":\"custom\",\"typography_font_family\":\"RocknRoll One\"},\"elements\":[],\"widgetType\":\"text-editor\"}],\"isInner\":true}],\"isInner\":true},{\"id\":\"1b71d74\",\"elType\":\"section\",\"settings\":[],\"elements\":[{\"id\":\"d9b05c0\",\"elType\":\"column\",\"settings\":{\"_column_size\":100,\"_inline_size\":null},\"elements\":[],\"isInner\":true}],\"isInner\":true}],\"isInner\":false},{\"id\":\"c16cec4\",\"elType\":\"column\",\"settings\":{\"_column_size\":16,\"_inline_size\":4.984},\"elements\":[],\"isInner\":false}],\"isInner\":false},{\"id\":\"fe0fe4f\",\"elType\":\"section\",\"settings\":{\"structure\":\"40\",\"background_background\":\"classic\",\"__globals__\":{\"background_color\":\"\"}},\"elements\":[{\"id\":\"e6caed8\",\"elType\":\"column\",\"settings\":{\"_column_size\":25,\"_inline_size\":4.95},\"elements\":[],\"isInner\":false},{\"id\":\"a2ad937\",\"elType\":\"column\",\"settings\":{\"_column_size\":25,\"_inline_size\":51.88},\"elements\":[{\"id\":\"ba4ad7f\",\"elType\":\"section\",\"settings\":{\"background_background\":\"classic\",\"__globals__\":{\"background_color\":\"\"},\"background_color\":\"#FFFFFF00\"},\"elements\":[{\"id\":\"1a753a0\",\"elType\":\"column\",\"settings\":{\"_column_size\":100,\"_inline_size\":null},\"elements\":[{\"id\":\"802f83c\",\"elType\":\"widget\",\"settings\":{\"image\":{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/cobberlink.xyz\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2022\\/04\\/bruce-mars-AndE50aaHn4-unsplash-scaled-e1649260891887.jpg\",\"id\":2289,\"alt\":\"\",\"source\":\"library\"}},\"elements\":[],\"widgetType\":\"image\"}],\"isInner\":true}],\"isInner\":true}],\"isInner\":false},{\"id\":\"3f84302\",\"elType\":\"column\",\"settings\":{\"_column_size\":25,\"_inline_size\":37.876},\"elements\":[{\"id\":\"f05c64c\",\"elType\":\"widget\",\"settings\":{\"title\":\"Test Your Knowledge\",\"align\":\"center\",\"typography_typography\":\"custom\",\"title_color\":\"#000000\",\"typography_font_family\":\"RocknRoll One\"},\"elements\":[],\"widgetType\":\"heading\"},{\"id\":\"d2bcfa7\",\"elType\":\"widget\",\"settings\":{\"editor\":\"<p><b>Hooray! <\\/b>You have completed the learning of the brief history of Melbourne.
